Abstract 

Understanding spatial correlations in language is an essential component of human-like intelligence in artificial intelligence systems. This research presents a novel approach to studying the ability of large language models (LLMs) to encode and decode spatial-temporal information purely from textual descriptions. While prior works have studied LLM reasoning through 2D spaces, we seek to fill the gap in 3D spaces. We present a new task for testing the spatial-temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through pathfinding in simulated 3D environments. We feed LLMs a textual description of 3D grid dimensions, a starting point, a target point, and obstacle coordinates to test the modelsâ€™ abilities to plan and output a correct path sequence to the target. As natural language descriptions increase in complexity in higher dimensions, we believe LLMs would have difficulty tracking and understanding the spatial-temporal orientation of our 3D environment relative to standard 2D tasks. Corrobo- rated by the worse path finding performance in 3D compared to 2D, we show that LLMs struggle to accurately reason about 3D spaces, which is exacerbated as each dimension increases in size.
