<s>[INST] Provide a sequence of actions to navigate a world to reach a goal similarly to the examples below. The world is represented as a 3D grid with coordinates (X, Y, Z), where (0, 0, 0) is the bottom-left-back corner and the maximum coordinates represent the top-right-front corner. 
Task: You are in a 3 by 3 by 3 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (0,1,0), (0,1,2) and (0,0,0). Go from (2,0,1) to (1,0,0) [/INST]
